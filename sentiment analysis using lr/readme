# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression

This project implements a simple **Sentiment Analysis** model using **Logistic Regression** from scratch in Python. The model classifies tweets as **positive** or **negative** based on word frequencies and logistic regression.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Text preprocessing using stemming, tokenization, and stopword removal.
- Feature extraction using word frequencies.
- Logistic Regression implementation from scratch (no sklearn).
- Model training using gradient descent.
- Evaluation of model accuracy on test data.

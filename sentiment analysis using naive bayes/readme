ðŸ’¬ Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis with Tweets
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on tweets. It classifies tweets as positive or negative, based on the words they contain.

ðŸ“š Overview
This project includes the following key components:

Data Preprocessing
Tokenization and cleaning of tweet text.

Frequency Dictionary (freqs)
A dictionary of word-label pairs (e.g., ('happy', 1)) with their frequency counts.

Training the Naive Bayes Model

Calculates:

Vocabulary size V

Positive and negative word counts N_pos, N_neg

Document counts D, D_pos, D_neg

Log Prior: logprior = log(D_pos / D_neg)

Log Likelihood for each word

Prediction

Computes the sum of log likelihoods + logprior to predict tweet sentiment.

Evaluation

Accuracy of the model on test data.

Word Ratio Analysis

Computes how strongly a word is associated with positive or negative sentiment
